# Early Prototype

This folder contains resources and documentation related to the early prototype development of the CO2 Mask project.

## Contents
- `measurements`: Measurements during testing of our prototype.
- `pcb`: Files to recreate the PCB.
- `3M-6000M-Mask.jpg`: Image of the 3M 6000 series mask used in early designs.
- `breadboardCircuit.jpg`: Picture of the breadboard circuit setup used in prototyping.
- `connectBLEvideo.mov`: Video demonstrating the connection to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
- `prototype.jpg`: Image of the early prototype of the CO2 Mask.
- `unattachedComponents.jpg`: Photo of components that were unattached during prototyping.

This folder helps document the progression and iteration of the mask design.

## Overview

The early prototypes in this folder serve as the foundation for the initial design and concept of the CO2 Mask. These early versions helps to shape the final model by providing key insights into the mask's design, functionality, and potential improvements.
