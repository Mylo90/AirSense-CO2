# CO2 and Temperature Sensing Mask for Athletes

This project aims to develop a smart mask for athletes to monitor CO2 levels and temperature in real-time, helping to track respiratory performance during physical activities. The sensor, based on the STC31 CO2 sensor, is embedded in a gas mask-like design and captures real-time data, providing athletes and fitness enthusiasts with insights into their CO2 exhalation and respiratory patterns.

The mask is particularly useful for monitoring breathing efficiency, CO2 combustion, and overall respiratory performance during exercise. By connecting the device to a Bluetooth-enabled phone or tablet, users can view real-time data on their CO2 levels and temperature via a dedicated app.

## Key Features:
- **Continuous CO2 and Temperature Monitoring**: Tracks both exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and breath temperature in real-time, providing comprehensive insights into respiratory efficiency and variations in breathing patterns under physical exertion.

- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Wirelessly transmits real-time data to paired devices, allowing users to monitor their breathing metrics live on their smartphone or fitness tracker for immediate feedback and progress tracking.

- **Compact, Lightweight Design**: Designed for athletes and active individuals, the device is small, lightweight, and easily integrated into sportswear or fitness equipment, ensuring comfort and convenience during workouts.

**Target Audience**: Athletes and fitness enthusiasts who is seeking to improve their breathing performance and monitor CO2 output during exercise. Our product enables users to optimize their workouts by offering valuable insights to respiratory function and efficiency under physical exertion.
