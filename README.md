# CO2 and Temperature Sensing Mask for Athletes
</p>

This project aims to develop a smart mask that measures CO2 concentration and temperature near the user's mouth during physical activity. The sensor, based on the STC31 CO2 sensor, is embedded in a gas mask-like design and captures real-time data, providing athletes and fitness enthusiasts with insights into their CO2 exhalation and respiratory patterns.

The mask is particularly useful for monitoring breathing efficiency, CO2 combustion, and overall respiratory performance during exercise. By connecting the device to a Bluetooth-enabled phone or tablet, users can view real-time data on their CO2 levels and temperature via a dedicated app.

## Key Features <br />
### CO2 Monitoring  <br />
Tracks exhaled CO2 concentration in real-time. <br />
### Temperature Sensing <br />
Measures the temperature within a breath, capturing real-time variations as air passes over it. Used for added insights. <br />
### Bluetooth Connectivity <br />
Wirelessly transmits data to a paired device for easy monitoring. <br />
### User Target <br />
Designed for athletes and everyday exercisers looking to enhance their breathing performance and track CO2 output during workouts. <br />

This project helps users optimize their workouts by providing a better understanding of their respiratory system and its efficiency under physical exertion.
